Easy to implement loading screen for websites.<br>
Just add the loadingScreen.js file in your project and<br>

![loadingscreenexample](https://github.com/Lemon2311/loadingScreen.js/assets/63803133/f381a225-a83f-4e85-8a15-ffddcc4bcc7d)
<br>
Make sure to include type="module" to the script reference<br>

and the loading screen will appear when your website is opened, and will dissapear when js is loaded.
