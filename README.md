Easy to implement loading screen for websites. Right now copy paste-ing the code into your main js file, will add a loading screen to your
website whatever the content of your html file might be, that will cover the hole screen, showing a loading sign, till js is loaded.
LoadingScreen also has hide(); and show(); functions, and will eventually be implemented so that when using const loadingScreen = new LoadingScreen(),
the loading screen can be used by calling functions onto it without adding any html in plus. example: loadingScreen.hideOnJsLoad();
